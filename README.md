**ok** is a strongly-duck-typed language, heavily influenced by Go. The goals
are:

1. **Strongly-typed**, but can use type inference in most places.
2. **Only decimal math** for absolute precision in all calculations.
3. **Syntax that is extremely simple** and very fast to parse for compilation.
4. TODO: **Avoids code that can lead to common runtime bugs** - no global
variables, nils, dereferencing or variables/arguments that have defaults.
5. TODO: **Functions are also objects and interfaces as themselves**.
6. TODO: **Testing is first-class**.

Installation
============


Precompiled Binaries
--------------------

You can find ready to go binaries for Mac, Windows and Linux on the
[Releases page](https://github.com/elliotchance/ok/releases).

These do not require any dependencies.


go get
------

If you have Go installed, you can install or update the latest version of ok
with:

```bash
go get -u github.com/elliotchance/ok
```


From Source
-----------

You will need to have Go 1.14+ installed to build from source.


Command Line Interface
======================

run
---

Programs in ok are directories containing one or more `.ok` files. You can run a
program by specifying the directory (or see the included tests/):

```bash
ok run my/program
```

version
-------

`ok version` will show the current version and the date it was built.


Language Specification
======================

Comments
--------

Comments begin with `//` and are terminated by a new line. Comments can exist on
the same line as code:

```
// This is a comment.
print("Hi") // Also a comment
```

Data Types
----------

ok supports these data types:

- `bool`: [Booleans](#booleans)
- `char`: [Characters](#characters)
- `data`: [Data](#data)
- `number`: [Numbers](#numbers)
- `string`: [Strings](#strings)

Expressions
-----------

An expression resolves to a single value and can be recursive. An expression is
one of:

1. A [literal](#Literals).
2. `(` [expression](#Expressions) `)`.
3. [expression](#Expressions) [binary operator](#Operators) [expression](#Expressions).
4. [unary operator](#Operators) [expression](#Expressions).

Literals
--------

### Booleans

A boolean can be either `true` or `false`.

### Characters

A character represents a single symbol and is wrapped in single-quotes (`'`').
The symbol must be a UTF-8 code point.

Examples:

- `'a'` - valid ASCII and UTF-8.
- `'ðŸ˜ƒ'` - valid UTF-8.
- `'hi'` - not valid.

### Data

A data value represents zero or more bytes. Data can be created with literals by
using backticks (`\``).

Examples:

- `\`\`` - zero bytes.
- `\`hello\`` - 5 bytes.
- `\`ðŸ˜ƒ\`` - 4 bytes.

### Numbers

Numbers can be represented in two forms. Each allows an optional proceeding
negative sign:

- Integers: `1234`, `0`, `-230`, etc.
- Decimals: `1.23`, `17.0`, `0.0001`, etc.

Numbers are exact (unlike IEEE 754 floating point approximations) and have no
practical limitation in magnitude or precision. The precision of a number can be
defined explicitly in the literal based on the number of digits after the `.`,
including zeros:

- `12` - precision is 0.
- `12.3` - precision is 1.
- `12.00` - precision is 2.

Zeros on the left will always be removed. For example `0012.3` will be reduced
to `12.3`. However, zeros on the right will never be removed because that would
modify the precision. For example `0.1300` will remain as such. This represents
a decimal with a precision of 4.

Numbers cannot start with a `.`. For example `.1` is not valid. However, `0.1`
is valid.

When printing numbers the precision is preserved. So `1.300` will also display
as `1.300`.

Number have the value of a negative zero (`-0`). This is always normalised as
`0`.

Divide and remainder with a denominator of zero (ie. division by zero) will
raise an error.

### Strings

Strings can be any length (including zero) and must be wrapped in double-quotes
(`"`).

Examples:

- `""` - an empty string (zero length).
- `"hello world"` - a string containing 11 characters.


Operators
---------

The following table describes the supported binary operators. All binary
operations require the same type on the left and right.

|       | `bool` | `char` | `data` | `number` | `string` |
| ----- | ------ | ------ | ------ | -------- | -------- |
| `+`   | No     | No     | Yes    | Yes      | Yes      |
| `-`   | No     | No     | No     | Yes      | No       |
| `*`   | No     | No     | No     | Yes      | No       |
| `/`   | No     | No     | No     | Yes      | No       |
| `%`   | No     | No     | No     | Yes      | No       |
| `and` | Yes    | No     | No     | No       | No       |
| `or`  | Yes    | No     | No     | No       | No       |
| `==`  | Yes    | Yes    | Yes    | Yes      | Yes      |
| `!=`  | Yes    | Yes    | Yes    | Yes      | Yes      |
| `>`   | No     | Yes    | No     | Yes      | Yes      |
| `>=`  | No     | Yes    | No     | Yes      | Yes      |
| `<`   | No     | Yes    | No     | Yes      | Yes      |
| `<=`  | No     | Yes    | No     | Yes      | Yes      |

The following table describes the unary operators.

|       | `bool` | `char` | `data` | `number` | `string` |
| ----- | ------ | ------ | ------ | -------- | -------- |
| `-`   | No     | No     | No     | Yes      | No       |
| `not` | Yes    | No     | No     | No       | No       |

When evaluating expressions the order of operations is influenced by the
precedence of the operator. The precedence from most to least important:

1. `*`, `/`, `%`
2. `+`, `-`

Examples:

- `1 + 2 + 3` is evaluated as `1 + (2 + 3)`
- `1 + 2 * 3` is evaluated as `1 + (2 * 3)`
- `1 * 2 + 3` is evaluated as `(1 * 2) + 3`

Other notes:

1. All arithmetic operations return a number that has the same precision as the
greatest precision input.

2. The remainder operator (`%`) is not the same as a modulo operator. Whereas as
modulo operation will always return a positive number, a remainder may be
negative if one of the inputs is also negative.


FAQ
===

## Why does "3 / 2 = 2?"

All numbers have a precision. The precision is the number of digits after the
decimal place. For integers (whole numbers) the precision is zero. When
performing any arithmetic operation the output precision will be the same as the
highest input precision.

So, in this case both inputs have a precision of 0 and so that is also used in
the output precision. On top of that any numbers is rounded half-up to fit
within the precision, so `1.5` becomes `2`.

`3.0 / 2` or `3 / 2.0` would produce `1.5`.
