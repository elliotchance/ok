**ok** is a strongly-duck-typed language. It has the rigidness and runtime
safety of a strongly-typed language while providing a lot flexibility through
interfaces and a simplified typing system.

You can try it now (with examples) at [play.getok.dev](https://play.getok.dev),
or read more about the language highlights in
[Why OK?](https://github.com/elliotchance/ok/wiki/Why-OK%3F).

documentation.
