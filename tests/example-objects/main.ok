// When a function has a single return type that is also the same name
// as the function, this is called a constructor. Constructors are used
// to create stateful functions. Sometimes called objects, records or
// structures in other languages.

    // start with a capital letter. Arguments that follow the same rules will be
    // treated the same way.
