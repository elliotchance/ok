// When a function has a single return type that is also the same name
// as the function, this is called a constructor. Constructors are used
// to create stateful functions. Sometimes called objects, records or
// structures in other languages.
func person(name string) person {
    // When you set variables here, they will be accessible outside.

    // always return itself.
